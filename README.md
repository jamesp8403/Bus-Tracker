# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description

This repo utilizes mapbox and uses markers and animation to show the bus route from MIT to Harvard.

## How to run

To run this code, you can fork and clone this repo. Once you have the HTML, JavaScript and CSS files, then you can open the html file in the browser. You can then click on the button to see the marker move from MIT to Harvard following the bus route.

## Roadmap of future improvements

I would like to get the marker to correspond to the actual location of the bus on its route.
