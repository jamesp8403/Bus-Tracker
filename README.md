# Real-Time Bus Tracker

## Description

This repo utilizes mapbox and uses markers and animation to show the bus route from MIT to Harvard.

## How to run

To run this code, you can fork and clone this repo. Once you have the HTML, JavaScript and CSS files, you will also need your own access token from mapbox.com. Once you enter your access token on the JS page, then you can open the html file in the browser. You can then click on the button to see the markers for each bus move every 15 seconds along their bus route.

## Roadmap of future improvements

I would like to show bus routes in other locations.
